# Facial_Attendance 
This was a project to build an attendance system using facial identification. It is still under the works, and I tested it on five of my colleagues.
There are five main scripts/files in this repo.  
1. automaticemail.py -- this enables the SMTP connection and sends the attendance file  
2. facerecog_training.py -- this scripts trains your image data set to generate a face recogntion model  
3. train.pkl -- the AI model  
4. mockcsvcreator.py -- hold the necessary functions for creating and editing csv files  
5. realtimefacerecogmodel.py -- the file that actually runs to capture images  
Exciting learning experience to be honest
